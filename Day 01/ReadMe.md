## Enivroment &mdash;

- Text Editor
- Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE)

<br />

## Who Use Python &mdash;

1. Software Developers
   - Backend Dev, Web applications (eg. Django, Flask)
2. Data Scientists and Analysts
   - Data analysis, data visualization an statistical modeling
3. AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning)
   - TensorFlow, Pytorch and Keras
4. Engineers
   - Automation, simulations (eg. Rasberry Pi)
5. Cybersecurity, Networking
   - Creating Custom Security Tools
6. Game Developers
   - Pygame

<br/>

## What is Programming &mdash;

1. Creating Algorithms
   - sorting and saving number and data
2. Writing code
   - Programmers must write code (Java, Python, C++, C#, asp.net, etc.)
3. Compiling and Interpreting to Codes
   - must compile and interpret what we've written
   - Compiler : Code (C => .c (windows), java => .class (any platform (mac, window, linux) => need engine))
   - Interpreter : js, php and etc.
4. problem Solving
   - Fixing Error (firstly, divide into small parts and fixing each other)
5. Debugging
   - Find and Fix Bugs
6. Testing
   - Testing What you Develope (easy to use and still have bugs)
7. Creating Software Applications
   - Creating Software (Web App, Mobile App, Desktop App)
8. Automation
   - Repetitive Process
9. Building User Interface (UI)
   - Creating GUI for end-user
10. Maintaing and Optimizing

- For Update and add new Features

<br />

## What are Programmers &mdash;

1. Writing Codes
2. Creating Software or Applications
   - Web Development
   - Mobile Developement
   - Game Development
   - Data Science
   - Cybersecurity
3. Problem Solving
4. Testing and Debugging
5. Optimizing Code
6. Collaboration
   - Developers, Designers, project Manager and etc.
7. Maintaining Software

## What is Programming Language &mdash;

1. Syntax - HTML/CSS also have syntax
2. Instruction - HTML/CSS also have syntax
3. Data Types - HTML does not have Data-type but CSS have string data-type
4. Compiler and Interpreter
   - Compiler Languages : (C, C++, Go(Goland), etc.)
   - Interpreter Languages : Python
5. Variables and Functions
6. High-Level or Low-Level Language
   - High-Level Languages (Pyton, Java, etc.)
   - Low-Level Languags (Assembly, Machine Code)

- High-Level Language
- Assembly Code
- Machine Langauge
- Hardware

<br/>

## Why HTML is not Programming Language &mdash;

- Hypertext Markup Language
- No Logic, Data Manipulation, Computation, Control Structures
- Description only Data
- No Variables and Functions
- Static Content
- Neither Compiler nor Interpreter

<br />

## Why CSS is not Programming Language &mdash;

- Cascading Stylesheets
- Neither Compiler nor Interpreter
- SSL (Style Sheet Language) or SPL (Static Presentation language)
- Not Logic-based Language so can't computattion

<br />

## JavaScript &mdash;

1. Interpreter
   - Browsers (Chrome, Mozilla, Edge and etc.)
2. JIT (just-in-time) Compilation

<br />

## Markup Language vs Programming Language &mdash;

- Markup => Description
- Programming => Order

<br />

## Compiler vs Interpreter &mdash;

1. Compiler (source - high-level) to Machine(binary - low level) - eg.

```go
   import "fmt" // Libraries

   // Custom Function

      func myFun(){
         fmt.Println("Hello Aung Aung"); // Linking to Libraries File
      }
```

2. Compiling

   - go build -o program testProgram.go

3. Linking

   - Go Runtime, Libraries, Dependency Files, Binary File and etc.

4. Execution
   - machine code (binaries - 0101)

## Interpreter &mdash;

1. Python Source Code
   - Byte code(format => .pyc)
2. Interpreted line by line(PVM -> Python Virtual Machine)

<br />

## How Python Code Work &mdash;

1. Interpreted Language

   - Both Intrepretation and Compilation
   - Python Source Code(.py)

   ```py
      print("Hello, Aung Aung")
   ```

2. Interpretation
3. Byte code(format -> .pyc)
   - Bytecode is Platform-independent(any platforms)
   - PVM -> CPU -> Run
4. JIT -> Just-in-Time Compilation
   - pypy -> Compiler(working like cache)
